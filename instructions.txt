How to approach programming assignments!

1. Figure out EXACTLY what your program will do. Every single step and what needs to happen.

- For hangman, we need a list of words, have the user keep guessing, keep track of their correct/incorrect guesses, let them know when the game is over, if they have lives, etc.

2. Pseudocode/Figure out what functions you should create/Figure out what modules you need to import

- Function to print out the underscores (_ _ _), function to ask the user to guess, function to figure out if guess is correct, etc.

3. Code it!

4. Test/debug it.

5. When you think you're ready, upload to Github, write the README, etc. whatever you want!
